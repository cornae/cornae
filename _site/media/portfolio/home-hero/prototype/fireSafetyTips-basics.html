						<h4>Responsive Action - Know the Basics</h4>
						<p>Accidents can happen and fire accidents can occur even when you practice prevention. When people have been educated about what to do and how to take action in the event of a fire or emergency, they can be responsive instead of reactive and take the important steps that can save lives. In this section you will find basic emergency action information everyone should be familiar with, as well as life saving instructions for specific groups with unique circumstances and needs.</p>

					<h5>Basics for Everyone</h5>

HomeHero&trade; has assembled educational information from leading <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=244&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets" rel="outbound">fire safety prevention</a> authorities that will help you learn the primary actions you and your family should take if a fire accident occurs in your home. Try to visit two or three of these sites, as each will offer additional ideas and items for you to consider.</p>

Be prepared to respond to home fire accidents and other emergencies with fire safety knowledge and confidence by always having smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home.
