					<div id="introduction">
						<P>Managing your home for fire safety and prevention is an important part of <a href="fireSafetyAwareness.html">reducing the risks</a> of potential fire and personal injury. Most fires occur unexpectedly because they are caused by the most ordinary, everyday items you would normally consider safe. A stove burner, a <a href="preventionTopicCandles.html">candle</a>, a <a href="myHomeSafety-bathroom.html">hairdryer</a> and many more frequently used home appliances can become a silent fire hazard.</p>
						<P>Use our simple interactive My Home Safety model. Roll over the different areas of the house, you will be shown links to valuable fire safety information organized by state and federal <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/" rel="outbound">fire safety authorities</a>.</p>
