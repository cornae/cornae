					<div id="introduction">
						<h3></h3>

						<P>Fire safety and prevention should be practiced year round and especially during holiday and seasonal times.  Camping, picnics, fireworks, and <a href="myHomeSafety-outdoors.html">outdoor grills</a> can all lead to danger if not handled properly.</P>  
						<P>There are lots of things to think about during the holiday seasons that include potential fire hazards. Using a real <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/newsReleaseDetails.asp?categoryid=488&itemId=20114" rel="outbound">Candles</a> are a particular danger, along with flammable decorations, holiday lighting, flammable plant materials like <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/citizens/all_citizens/home_fire_prev/holiday-seasonal/treefire.shtm" rel="outbound">Christmas tree</a> definitely gives your holiday d&#232;cor that added touch. However, without proper care and maintenance that tree can lead to disaster.  Be sure to water your tree daily to keep it moist.  Before adding decorations or strands of lights, be sure to inspect them for damage.  The <a href="www.nfpa.org" rel="outbound">National Fire Prevention Association</a> (NFPA) reported that twice as many fires are started by lit candles in the month of December, so practice extreme caution if your decorations include <a href="preventionByTopic.html">candlelight</a>.</P>
						<P>Each season brings unique risks for fire safety in the home. Open flames, small and large, whether from candles, fireplaces or barbecue grills, can take an annual toll in lives as well as create millions of dollars in damage.</P>
						<P>Fire safety precautions should be reviewed and discussed at the beginning of each season, and necessary care should be taken by each member of your family to ensure safe and happy recreation and celebrations. </P>

					<h5>Winter Heating Hazards</h5> 
						<P><strong>Fact: Heating equipment is the leading cause of home fires in the United States during December, January and February.</strong></P>

					<P>Safe handling and maintenance of heating equipment should be a key part of your family's wintertime <a href="fireSafetyPlans.html">safety awareness</a> and preparation.  A furnace inspection by a qualified professional is a good way to start, and if you have a <a href="myHomeSafety-familyroom.html">fireplace</a>, having the chimney checked for a buildup of flammable deposits will reduce the risk of a chimney fire. </P>
						<P>If space heaters are used in your home, everyone should know the dangers of placing a <a href="myHomeSafety-bedroom.html">portable heater</a> too close anything that might burn, including drapes, upholstery or clothing. Cords and outlets for electric heaters should be checked, and proper ventilation should be considered when using heaters fueled by kerosene. </P>

					<h5>Holiday Fire Hazards</h5> 
						<P><strong>Fact: The number of fires started by candles almost doubled during December.</strong></P>
						
						<P>Holidays bring a variety of potential fire hazards that deserve special attention because many of the activities and situations fall outside our normal routines. Candles are a particular danger, along with flammable decorations and plant materials like Christmas trees, holiday lighting and fireworks.</P> 
						<P>Many families have decided to use more flame retardant artificial Christmas trees to reduce the risk posed by live trees. A dry real tree is an extreme fire hazard. If you use a live tree during the Christmas season, purchase as fresh a tree as possible, keep it watered, and take it down as quickly as possible after the holiday.</P> 
						<P>Candles, particularly in the presence of children, represent a real danger. Fire safety experts</a> remind us to be careful when mounting and placing candles. It will go a long way toward reducing the risk. Children should never be left alone or unattended with burning candles.</P>
						<P>Take time to review the appropriate safety precautions at the beginning of each holiday season. Discuss them with your family and help them take the necessary actions that will ensure they enjoy safe and happy holiday celebrations throughout the year.</P>

					<h5>Summer Fire Hazards</h5> 
						<P><strong>Fact: Each year more than 8,000 Americans are injured by gas grill fires or fireworks.</strong></P>
						<P>Many of us have experienced the frightening result of a grease flare-up from <a href="myHomeSafety-outdoors.html">barbeque grill</a>, and propane gas grills pose unique safety hazards with explosive consequences. Knowing proper safety techniques, good maintenance practices, and having a cautious approach to these fun but potentially dangerous summertime activities will bring greater peace of mind and enjoyment to your family's summer recreation.</P> 
						<P>Most gas grill fires and explosions are caused by gas leaks, blocked tubes, and overfilled propane tanks. Check your tank, hoses and valves with soapy water to expose any leaks. Always follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and have your grill repaired by a professional if needed.</P>
						<P>Fireworks are exciting but risky and are best left to the professionals at commercial exhibitions only. </P>
						<P>Here are some websites that provide you with information on how you can reduce the risk of fire from many of the common season hazards, and help make your home safer for your whole family. Try to visit two or three of these sites, as each will offer additional ideas and items to consider.</P>
