						<h4>Important Skills for Family Fire Drills</h4>

				</div>
					<div id="mainText">
						<h5>Prepare with a Fire Safety Plan</h5>
 						<p>First and most importantly, prepare your family with adequate and fully functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home. Also consider placing multiple UL registered fire extinguishers in areas that are close at hand during an emergency. When fire strikes, the first priority is escaping and preserving the life of all family members. This will be easier if you have a plan that everyone knows about, understands and has practiced regularly.</p>

						<h5>Testing the Doors</h5>
						<p>Your children should know the danger of opening a door into a fire. Learn together the important steps to take if they see smoke coming from under a door. Help them learn the important ways to test for heat. </p>

						<h5>Get Under the Smoke</h5>
						<p>Discuss with your children the dangers of smoke, and learn how to practice what is required if your home has smoke. Educate your family on what needs to be done if there is a lot of smoke, and learn the best ways to get out of your home safely. </p>

						<h5>Get out of the House</h5>
						<p>Children, like adults, should know the importance of not re-entering the house once outside and getting to the designated meeting place as quickly as possible. Fire safety authorities recommend that you practice your escape plan at least twice a year.</p>

						<h5>Stop, Drop and Roll</h5>
						<p>Learn what fire authorities recommend for family in-home fire drills. At each fire drill remind your children of the importance of not running if their clothes should catch on fire. Have fun together letting them demonstrate their drop and roll technique. Practice will help make this a more familiar response.</p>

						<h5>Getting Assistance - 911</h5>
						<p>Ask your child to demonstrate for you how he or she would get help by asking a familiar neighbor to dial 911.</p> 
						<p>HomeHero has identified some authoritative sites offering fire safety and prevention suggestions for the entire families. These sites will help you involve your whole family and make learning how to be better prepared interesting and fun. Try to visit two or three of these sites, as each will offer additional ideas and items to consider.</p>
