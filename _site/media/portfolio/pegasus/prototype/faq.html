					<div id="whereCanIPurchasePegasusProducts" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>Where can I purchase Pegasus products?</h3>

						<p>Pegasus products are sold at Expo Design Centers, The Home Depot, Expo.com, and homedepot.com and kitchen and bath specialty stores everywhere. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
					</div>

					<div id="howLongWillItTakeToInstallMyNewFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3 id="q2">How long will it take to install my new faucet?</h3>

						<p>You should be able to install a 4" bath faucet or an 8" kitchen faucet in about an hour. Installing tub, shower and Roman tub faucets often requires cutting through wallboard, removing tile and so on. You may want to have a licensed professional install these faucets. Otherwise, allow 1-2 days to complete the job. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
					</div>

					<div id="whatToolsWillINeedToInstallMyNewFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3 id="q3">What tools will I need to install my new faucet?</h3>

						<p>Installations can vary depending on how your existing faucet was installed, but typically, you'll need a pipe wrench, an adjustable wrench, a screwdriver, pliers, Teflon tape and plumber's putty. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
					</div>

					<div id="whereCanIFindInstructionsForInstructionsForInstallingMyNewFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3 id="whereCanIFindInstructions">Where can I find instructions for installing my new faucet?</h3>

						<p>Detailed installation instructions and diagrams are included in the box with each product. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
					</div>

					<div id="howDoIRemoveMyOldValveStem" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3 id="q5">How do I remove my old valve stem?</h3>

						<p>Shut off water at the supply stop. Remove the faucet/shower handle (usually by popping off the top bezel, sometimes by loosening a setscrew on the side of the handle). Use a wrench at the BASE of the stem and turn counterclockwise. This also works for removing the entire cartridge assembly, which is sometimes necessary to remove the stem. Repair, replace the stem and reverse the above. Don't forget to turn the water back on. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
					</div>

					<div id="whatIsThePurposeOfTheFlatWasherOnTheTopOfThePopupAssembly" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>What is the purpose of the flat washer on the top of the popup assembly?</h3>

						<p>The flat washer creates a smooth surface between the bottom of the popup head and the sink to ensure a good seal and to minimize scratching of the sink drain. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="myPopupAssemblyWillNotWorkProperlyInMySinkWhy" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>My popup assembly will not work properly in my sink. Why?</h3>

						<p>Although all sinks and faucets are built to a uniform standard dictated by IAPMO, sometimes a sink hole gets "out of round." On rare occasions, the pop up itself is out of tolerance. Sometimes the popup rod that runs behind the faucet and under the sink does not have enough clearance to drop straight down, which keeps the pop up from operating properly. Sometimes the link between the popup rod and the pop up is overtightened, too loose or bent, and jams. Usually a replacement rod, link or pop up (or all three) solves the problem. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="whatDoesBeCarefulNotToOvertightenReallyMean" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>What does "be careful not to overtighten" really mean?</h3>

						<p>Contrary to common sense, overtightening a nut on a threaded surface doesn't "really" make sure it won't leak. Instead, overtightening has the opposite effect. Most threaded rods have a slight taper, and overtightening will begin to break the threads (usually on the nut) and cause a slow leak, especially as pressure is applied to the system. This is a real problem when you have plastic nuts going onto a metal rod. If the nut has knurls or "wings," the rule of thumb is to use your hand/fingers to tighten. The next rule of thumb is, after it is tight, a quarter turn with a wrench will "seat" the nut. Remember, you can always tighten more if there is a leak, but if the nut or thread is damaged by overtightening, you have a problem.<br />

					<div id="howDoICleanTheAeratorOnMyFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>How do I clean the aerator on my faucet?</h3>

						<p>A clogged or dirty aerator can reduce water flow through a faucet. It's easy to clean the aerator. Close your drain assembly to prevent small parts from falling into the drain. Unscrew the aerator assembly on the end of the spout. Take out the plastic insert that water flows through. Turn the insert upside down and run water through it. This will flush out any dirt or debris that may be lodged in the assembly.</p>

						<p>Over time, if the water pattern from the aerator begins to spray irregularly, remove the aerator, soak it in vinegar overnight, rinse off the aerator screen, then replace. If the screen is really clogged, use a toothpick to clear the holes. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="myHotAndColdValvesAreDifficultToTurnOrTheySqueakWhatShouldIDo" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>My hot and cold valves are difficult to turn or they squeak. What should I do?</h3>

						<p>You probably have an older faucet that uses compression valves to turn the water on and off. You can rebuild the valve by buying a repair kit. Make sure you know what type of valve you have; there are literally hundreds of versions. If in doubt, take the valve with you to your local The Home Depot store. A repair kit usually includes washers and "O" rings and screws, apply some plumber's grease to ease the process. Note that rebuilding the valve will take longer than replacing the faucet with a brand new faucet. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="ThereIsALeakWhereMySupplyLinesConnectToTheFaucetWhatShouldIDo" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>There is a leak where my supply lines connect to the faucet. What should I do?</h3>

						<p>This problem occurs if there are imperfections on the threads of either the supply lines or the faucet. Wrap Teflon tape clockwise eight times around the threads on the faucet. This will seal any imperfections that may exist on either of the threads.<br />
						<a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="myHandleLoosensOverTimeAreThereAnySuggestionsForKeepingItTight" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>My handle loosens over time. Are there any suggestions for keeping it tight?</h3>

						<p>Use Locktite on the handle screw. (Note that this will prevent you from removing the handle if you later have to repair the valve or cartridge.) <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="howShouldICleanMyNewFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>How should I clean my new faucet?</h3>

						<p>Keep your faucet looking like new by cleaning it periodically with soap and water applied with a soft cloth or sponge. Avoid abrasive cleaners, steel wool and harsh chemicals as these will dull the finish. Use glass cleaner occasionally to help maintain the faucet's shine. To prevent water spots, wipe the faucet dry after use. Some faucets have a "living" finish of unprotected metal, usually a natural-looking copper or bronze. A living finish will change over time, acquiring a patina as it is exposed to air and water. Scrubbing a faucet with a living finish accelerates this process and may damage the base metal. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="howDoIFindTheSKUNumberForMyProductWhyWouldINeedIt" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>How do I find the SKU number for my product? Why would I need it?</h3>

						<p>The SKU is a six-digit number (e.g., 123456). Look for the SKU on your product's box or in the installation instructions. SKU numbers are also available on this Web site (see the product information page for your specific product). The SKU number indicates which faucet you have. You will need your SKU number if you ever need replacement parts or customer support for your product. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="whereCanIGetReplacementPartsIfNeeded" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>Where can I get replacement parts, if needed?</h3>

						<p>Your local The Home Depot store stocks most commonly needed replacement parts. You may also order any part at no charge by calling the toll-free customer support number for your product. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="canIGetMatchingAccessoriesForMyNewFaucet" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>Can I get matching accessories for my new faucet?</h3>

						<p>Yes. Products in matching styles and colors are available in select Pegasus series. Some lines include matching light fixtures, vanities and hardware. There are also accessories available that match the color of your faucet. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="whatIfIStillNeedHelp" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>What if I still need help?</h3>

						<p>We're ready to help if you need assistance with your Pegasus product. To access toll-free customer support for your product, please see the Contact section. <a href="#main" class="backToTop">Back to top</a></p>
				  </div>

					<div id="whatShouldIDoIfMyProductIsRecalled" class="questionAndAnswer">
						<h3>What should I do if my product is recalled?</h3>

						<p>If a Pegasus product is recalled, the product will be listed on the Product Recall page of homedepot.com. On this page, you'll find detailed information about the recall and any specific actions you should take.<br />
