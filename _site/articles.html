			    	01 February 2009: Dealing with labels
			    </h4>
			    <p class="summary">
			    	As suggested in the article 'Form follows function and achieving thereof', every input element on a form should ideally have a label. Labels give more meaning to input elements and makes them accessible. This article dives into dealing with labels and input fields for postal addresses on forms.

			    </h4>
			    <p class="summary">
			    	One of the most common interaction patterns one can find on forms is the date input group. They appear in all shapes and sizes in various applications and sign up forms on websites. Certain forms of appearance seem to be more popular in certain geographical areas than other. But other than that it is hard to find any pattern or rationale why one website has chosen for model X while the other has chosen model Y. The suspicion would rise that the date input method is often dictated by the way the backend would 'like' it. This is a situation which neither we, as interaction designers and consultants, nor the end user should settle for.

			    	21 March 2008: AJAX and the old world
			    </h4>
			    <p class="summary">
			    	Today, complex layout methods have made it possible to borrow from interaction patterns of desktop applications, including drop down menu bars, expanding trees and tabs. It's this exact inevitable shift of desktop application design patterns to the page metaphor that has more than often led to confusion amongst both web designers and end users. In this era of AJAX and RIAs, the possibilities for user interface designers have become infinite. Hence the question arises&#58;  Have all of these developments actually led to an improved user experience?

			    	03 February 2008: Form follows function and achieving thereof
			    </h4>
			    <p class="summary">
			    	Forms can be dreadfully tricky to style and structure properly. Several articles that are out there focus on best practises for building forms using HTML en CSS. This article focusses in a non technical fashion on the use of meaningful nomenclature and how form semantics relate to elements that current markup standards have to offer. It may help anyone to recognise structural patterns and to compose forms properly.

			    	In the beginning there was the internet. It was formless and empty and information was hovering on the lines. Then the web was created, to give house to the information. Then there was HTML. It gave structure to the information and the people saw that it was good.
