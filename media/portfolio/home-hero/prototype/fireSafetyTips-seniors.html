					<div id="introduction">
						<h4>Unique Needs</h4>
						<p>If you or someone sharing your home is over 65, some additional considerations need to be developed for your family safety checklist and home escape plan. Evacuation time in a fire emergency is always critical and older adults may require more time and assistance to escape. Learn how to develop and practice a <a href="fireSafetyPlans.html">fire safety plan</a> for your family that takes into account any older adults and their mobility.
						<P>Here are a few of the considerations you will want to address as you plan for a fire emergency.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mainText">
					
						<h5> Evacuation </h5> 
						<p>As we age, we expect to slow down.  Therefore, in order to provide as much time as possible to safely escape from a fire accident, the earliest possible detection is needed.  Consider installing extra fire alarms throughout your home in any place where there is potential for fire.  New wireless interconnected smoke and <a href="smokeAlarm.html">carbon monoxide alarm systems</a> help ensure that the first siren is heard by anyone in close range.</p>

						<h5> Escape Routes</h5> 
						<p>Often, when older family members live with us, we expand our living spaces to accommodate them.  We turn <a href="myHomeSafety-basement.html">basements</a> or other home additions into comfortable living quarters.</p>  
						<p>However, with these expansions come additional fire risks and hazards.  Housing on a second level requires special attention to fire escape routes that will assist senior citizens as they are sometimes not as capable of using both traditional and secondary escape routes.</p> 
						<p>Areas such as <a href="myHomeSafety-entryway.html">hallways</a>, stairwells, or windows may be challenging. Basements or subterranean in-law suites create other issues as often these areas do not have extra escape portals such as windows, patios, or decks that allow for easy exit.  Learn how you can improve their safety escape route.</p>

						<h5> Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarms</h5> 
						<p>Also, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors located in close proximity to the primary rooms that they occupy can alert them to dangers before they become life threatening. UL registered <a href="fireExtinguisher.html">fire extinguishers</a> should be kept close at hand and seniors should be taught how to properly use them in the event of an accident.</p>
						<p>HomeHero&trade; has identified some authoritative sites offering fire safety suggestions for seniors and their families. Try to visit two or three of these sites, as each will offer additional ideas and items to consider.</p>
