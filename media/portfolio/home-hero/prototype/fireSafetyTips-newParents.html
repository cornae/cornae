					<h2>Home Safety Tips</h2>

					<h3 class="subHeader">New Parents &amp; Families</h3>

					<div id="introduction">
					
						<p>Our number one concern as parents is to keep our family safe and healthy. With the right fire safety knowledge and tools, you will be able to educate your family with the skills and techniques that will help keep them safe if a fire accident should strike your home.</p> 
						<p>Statistics have shown that children are particularly vulnerable in fire situations. By taking the time now to learn how to prepare for a fire emergency, you can improve your family's reaction time and help your children better understand how to respond in an emergency. Give yourself greater peace of mind knowing that everyone in your family has been better educated. </p>
						<p>Here are several concerns you may want to address as you develop your fire action plan.</p> 
					</div>
					
								
					<div id="mainText">
						<h5>Reduce the Fear</h5>
						<P>Teach your children the importance of staying calm.</P>
						<p>Fire alarms are noisy and scary to young children, particularly in the dark at night. Setting off the alarm as part of your escape drill practice, will help familiarize them with the excitement and distraction it can cause. Consider an announced night time drill after everyone has mastered a <a href="fireSafetyPlans.html">family escape plan</a>. Make sure everyone wakes to the sound of the alarm. Unique <a href="smokeAlarm.html">voice technology systems</a> are now available that provide verbal instructions to help direct your family with the appropriate action needed.</p>

						<h5>The Safe Way Out</h5>
						<p>Children can sleep very soundly. <a href="fireSafetyTips-kids.html">Educate your family</a> on who should be assigned as the responsible adult for waking and getting the children out. Refer to fire safety authorities for direction and recommendations and include everyone in the discussion of alternative exits for each room of the house. Consider whether the children will be able to open doors and windows on their own, or if a fire ladder is needed from upper level rooms.</p>
						<p>Consider making a <a href="http://www.ou.edu/oupd/fireprev.htm" rel="outbound">fire escape map</a> of your house that shows at least two exits from each room as well as a safe meeting place outside. Involve the children in creating the map so they pay more attention and remember more details. After creating the family fire exit map, display it prominently to help remind everyone of the fire exits available to them in the event of a fire accident. </p>
