						<h4>Unique Dwellings - Manufactured Housing Safety </h4>
						<p>As condominiums and apartment style living are on the rise in America, we should consider the unique fire safety challenges they pose for millions of people. High&#45;rise buildings present special circumstances for escape plans and places greater importance on fire safety preparation for you and your family.</p>
						<p>We have selected specific information offering a variety of preventative suggestions related to the unique safety hazards associated with apartment or condominium dwelling. 
 					
						<ul>
							<li>Create a <a href="fireSafetyTips-checklist.html">Fire Safety Checklist</a> and <a href="fireSafetyPlans.html">Fire Safety Plan</a> for your family and practice it together. </li>
							<li>Make sure you are educated on fire safety evacuation plans for your building and safety systems so you can respond rapidly when alerted. </li>
							<li>Consider placing additional smoke and <a href="smokeAlarm.html">carbon monoxide alarms</a> throughout your unit. </li>
							<li>Integrate fire extinguishers throughout the apartment and make them easy to get to and placed in areas where everyone can see them. </li>
						</ul>

					<h5>Mobile Homes</h5>
						
						<p>Mobile homes have become a standard in American's home living alternatives. From secured to portable, all structures are subject to the same risks and fire hazards as other traditional housing structures. However, mobile homes require special attention to escape plans due to the limited exit access and flammable construction materials.</p> 
						<p>Fire safety experts inform us that older mobile homes may be at a higher fire safety risk because of construction utilizing more flammable materials than is currently allowed. Also, portable mobile homes often carry their fuel with them creating additional fire hazards to consider when planning. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Be better prepared for fire safety prevention by first learning, discussing and planning fire escape routes unique to your mobile home. </li>
						<li>Develop a fire safety checklist that everyone knows and participates in. </li>
						<li>Have plenty of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors as the sooner you are alerted, the faster you can respond.</li>
						<li>Have <a href="fireExtinguisher.html">fire extinguishers</a> available throughout your unit and be prepared to use them.</li>
 					</ul>
						<p>HomeHero&trade; is concerned for you and your family's fire safety awareness. Try to visit two or three of the sites we have selected, as they each offer additional ideas and information to consider.</p> 
						<p>We have also selected special websites offering fire safety and prevention information that addresses the unique circumstances of families living in apartments and mobile homes. The time you spend now will give you and your family greater peace of mind, and possibly prevent an accident from happening. </p>
