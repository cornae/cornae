					<h2>Safety Awareness</h2>
						<div id="mainText">
						<h5>Quarterly Checks</h5>  
						<p>Each season brings unique fire safety risks in the home. From the small open flames of <a href="preventionTopicCandles.html">candles</a>, to the larger fires we build in our <a href="myHomeSafety-familyroom.html">fireplaces</a> and <a href="myHomeSafety-outdoors.html">barbeque grills</a>, fire safety experts tell us that each has taken a toll annually in both lives and millions of dollars in damage.</p>
 						<p>Make it a habit for you and your family to begin each season with a review of the appropriate <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=247&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Seasonal%20safety" rel="outbound">seasonal fire safety hazards</a> and prevention techniques. Then have everyone take the necessary care that will ensure year round safety in your home.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=247&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Seasonal%20safety" rel="outbound">Safety precautions</a> should be reviewed at the beginning of each <a href="fireSafetyTips-seasonal.html">season</a>, discussed and the necessary care taken by each member of your family to ensure safe and happy recreation and celebrations. </p>

					<h5>Cooking Hazards</h5>
							<p><strong>Fact:  Unattended cooking is the leading cause of cooking fires in U.S. homes.</strong><a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=282&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Safety%20in%20the%20home/Cooking" rel="outbound"> >></a>
							<p>Today's busy lifestyles can be a recipe for disaster in the <a href="myHomeSafety-kitchen.html">kitchen</a>. Hectic routines, multi-tasking, and numerous distractions can lead to accidents that may result in fire. Take the time to review some of the common causes of <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=282&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Safety%20in%20the%20home/Cooking" rel="outbound">cooking related fires</a>, and make sure everyone in your family knows and understands how to avoid unnecessary risks. </p>

						<h5>Holiday Awareness </h5>
							<p><strong>Fact:  The number of fires started by candles almost doubles during December each year.<a href="http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=638&itemID=19184&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Safety%20in%20the%20home/Candles" rel="outbound"> >></a></strong></p> 
							<p>Holidays bring a variety of potential fire hazards, and require special attention because of the activities and situations that fall outside our normal routines. <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/newsReleaseDetails.asp?categoryid=488&itemId=20114" rel="outbound">Candles</a> are a particular danger, along with flammable decorations, holiday lighting, flammable plant materials like <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/citizens/all_citizens/home_fire_prev/holiday-seasonal/treefire.shtm" rel="outbound">Christmas trees</a>, and <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/07223.html" rel="outbound">fireworks</a>. </p> 
							<p>Safety precautions should be reviewed at the beginning of each holiday season, discussed with all family members and the necessary precautions taken by everyone to ensure safe and happy holiday celebrations throughout the year. </p> 
					
						<h5>Electrical Hazards </h5>
						<p><a href="http://www.firesafety.gov/directory/public/electrical.shtm" rel="outbound">Electrical hazards</a> are easily overlooked until they pose a real threat. Everyone in your family should be familiar with the common household dangers associated with electrical <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/citizens/all_citizens/home_fire_prev/electrical.shtm" rel="outbound">appliances</a>, <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml99/99069.html" rel="outbound">power cords</a> and <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=285&itemID=19048&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Electrical%20safety/Electrical%20circuit-interrupters" rel="outbound">wiring</a>.</p> 
 						<p><a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml03/03144.html" rel="outbound">Professionals</a> should be contacted when dealing with changes to wiring or the installation of any appliance or electrical equipment requiring more than a standard wall outlet. Periodic reviews of your home to look for potential problems is a great way to identify and correct potential electrical hazards.</p>

						<h5>First Aid Kit</h5>  
							<p>Being prepared for a fire emergency also means dealing with the problems of being displaced from your home. Because quick evacuation is often the best response when a fire strikes, what you take with you, including flashlights, prescription medicines and valuable documents, needs careful consideration and advance preparation. 
 							<p>Your whole family will enjoy greater peace of mind knowing they are prepared to respond effectively to a fire emergency. Learn how to organize your <a href="http://www.redcross.org/article/0,1072,0_312_5103,00.html" re="outbound">Fire Safety Kit</a> and where to store it for safe and easy access when you need it. 
 							<p>Here are some websites that can you and your family can become better prepared to prevent or respond to a fire emergency.
