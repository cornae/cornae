summary: Ineke Gmelig Meijling is a ceramicist who creates unique sculptures by
applying various oxides on thin layers of clay. The oxides create
stunningly deep colours which Cornelis tried to capture on this
website against a dark background and photography in the old Dutch
'Claire Obscure' tradition that was already used by Rembrandt van Rijn
and Johannes Vermeer back in the 17th century.
