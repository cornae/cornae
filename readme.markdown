# jekyll-skeleton

Hi. This is a [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site template you can clone/fork to create a skeleton for your own site.

You can configure services such as twitter, feedburner, google analytics and gravatar directly in the configuration file *_config.yml*. Once done, create new posts in the _posts folder just by launching 'rake new'.

As a result sample, check [my github site](http://chamerling.github.com).

Cheers!
